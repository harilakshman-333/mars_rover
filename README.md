DIY Mars Perseverance Rover Replica project. Inspired by the real rover currently exploring Mars, this project allows enthusiasts, students, makers, and robotics enthusiasts to build their own Mars rover

**Main Features:**
1. Rocker-Bogie Suspension: The replica employs a rocker-bogie suspension system, similar to the real Mars rovers. This design allows the rover to smoothly traverse uneven terrain and climb obstacles (such as rocks) up to twice the wheelâ€™s diameter while keeping all six wheels in contact with the ground.
2. Individual Wheel Motors: Each wheel has an independent DC motor for forward and backward movement.
3. Ackermann Steering Geometry: To efficiently steer the rover and prevent tire slipping during turns, the project implements Ackermann steering geometry. This ensures that inner steering wheels have a greater angle and slower speeds compared to outer wheels during turns.
4. Brain: Surprisingly, the brain of this Mars rover is an Arduino MEGA board. A custom PCB simplifies connections between components and the Arduino board.
5. FPV Camera: The rover features an FPV (First-Person View) camera controlled by stepper and servo motors. Real-time video is transmitted to a smartphone.
6. Appearance: While some parts are non-functional, they match the appearance of the real rover. The robotic arm is missing in this version, but future enhancements are planned.
